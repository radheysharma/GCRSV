# GCRSV
The Gesture-Controlled Rescue and Search Vehicle (GCRSV) project introduces an innovative approach to search and rescue robotics by implementing a [custom potentiometer](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3ea0pwOEMi5-custom-potentiometer?sharecode=FJPZShAeCS-0mlAEYh_FSl27fWRcAUoc2GjOTLSxF4s) model for wrist orientation detection.

#About
This is a project report of an ongoing project that was started in the 6th Semester of my B.Tech program. The team consists of me and my colleague [Saahil Choudhary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saahil-chaudhary-0a1915275/). This project was aimed at highlighting the potential of gesture-based control systems in improving the efficiency and reliability of search and rescue missions, ultimately contributing to the advancement of robotic technologies in critical scenarios by offering a cheap alternative to existing orientation detection systems.
The report also summarizes the various iterations of the project that we went through while making a physical prototype. From initial HC05 Bluetooth communication testing to potentiometer integration to the current prototype vehicle that can read potentiometer data wirelessly to perform desirable actions. It also showcases the various problems we faced and overcame (like low power intake from the battery that we solved with a DC power supply, hardware issues, etc.), as well as the current problems we face like low torque from the motor making rotation difficult, etc.

We are working on existing issues as well as making the custom potentiometer for the final prototype of the project.
